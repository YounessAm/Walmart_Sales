Weekly sales estimation


# The Project
Walmart's marketing service has asked you to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in their stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help them understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

## Deliverables 
- EDA and Visualizations
- A linear regression model on the dataset, that predicts the amount of weekly sales as a function of the other variables
- Interpretation of the coefficients of the model to identification of what features are important for the prediction
- Using regularization (Lasso and Ridge) to reduce overfitting
